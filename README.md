# plotly-challenge

For this assignment, I created four functions to execute the code.  The first function was used to create and format the different plots. I named all the variables used here and console logged them.  The second functions serves to import the data from the samples.json.  The third function runs the first two functions when a change occurs.  The fourth and final function utilized the function of the dropdown menu to initiate changes in the displayed data.  I did not attempt the bonus for this assignment.
